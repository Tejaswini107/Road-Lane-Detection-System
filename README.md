# Road Lane Detection

## Overview
This project detects and highlights road lane lines in images and videos using computer vision techniques. It is designed as a basic module for autonomous vehicle navigation and driver-assist systems.

## Key Features
- Detects sharp edges using **Canny Edge Detection**.
- Focuses on lane regions using a **Region of Interest (ROI)**.
- Detects straight lane lines with **Hough Transform**.
- Filters and averages detected lines based on slope.
- Handles video input and processes frames in real-time.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tejaswini107/Road-Lane-Detection-System.git
